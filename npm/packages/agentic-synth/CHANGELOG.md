## [0.1.12] - 2026-11-12

### Fixed
- Default Gemini model is now `gemini-2.5-flash`. The previous default `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (and the `gemini-1.5-*` routes) are retired and return 404, so calls relying on the default failed. Verified with a live call.

### Changed
- Optional `ruvector` peer dependency pinned to `0.3.26` (was `0.3.24`); verified `VectorDB` insert and search against it.

---

## [0.1.11] - 2026-11-11

### Changed
- `@google/generative-ai` is pinned to exactly `0.24.1`. The optional `ruvector` peer is pinned to exactly `0.3.24`.
- Package metadata: homepage https://ruv.io, repository and bugs URLs, keywords.

### Removed
- The optional peers `midstreamer@^1.0.0` and `agentic-robotics@^1.0.0`. No 1.x of either package exists, so the ranges could never resolve, and nothing in the package imports them. The README no longer presents them as built-in integrations.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-04

### Security
- CLI `config` no longer prints the full API key; `doctor --verbose` no longer prints key prefixes or config-file keys.
- A key passed as `apiKey` is only sent to the provider it was configured for. Switching provider via `configure()` no longer carries the previous provider's key over.

### Fixed
- A `model` not in the built-in route table is now used as given, instead of being silently replaced by a different (often more expensive) model.
- `apiKey` is honoured for `provider: 'openrouter'` (previously only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` worked).
- `timeout` is now applied to Gemini and OpenRouter requests; a stalled request no longer hangs forever.
- JSON extraction from model output no longer fails when prose with brackets follows the array.
- JSON Schema `integer` fields validate; time-series timestamps are normalised to ISO 8601 as documented.
- `generateStream()` now yields items (it yielded nothing before).
- `EventGenerator.generateLocal({ distribution: 'poisson' })` no longer throws for roughly 40% of calls.
- `generateBatch(..., 0)` no longer loops forever; `count` must be a positive integer.
- `doctor` removes its temporary probe file.
